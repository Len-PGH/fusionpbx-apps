WebRTC
*********

WebRTC app for FusionPBX is made by editing an existing FusionPBX app code and adding the code from the "Master FreeSWITCH code example".

 .. note:
 
   This app is a shell and you must provide the rest of the code to make the app functional.  This was done to respect the work of the original work put into the authoring of the "Master FreeSWITCH" book.
