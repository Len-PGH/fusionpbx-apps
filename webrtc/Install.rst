WebRTC
*********

WebRTC app for FusionPBX is made by editing an existing FusionPBX app code and adding the code from the "Master FreeSWITCH code example".  Also, keep in mind that you will need ssl certs working on the server.

**Note**
~~~~~~~~~
 
This app is a shell and you must provide the rest of the code to make the app functional.  This was done to respect the work of the original work put into the authoring of the "Master FreeSWITCH" book and can be obtained from the download code section from https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/mastering-freeswitch
